## File Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **code**: Contains the R code files for each question.
- **data**: Any data files used for analysis.
- **output**: Output files generated by the R code.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the assignment.

## Questions
1. **Question 1**: Engine displacement calculation and unit conversion.
2. **Question 2**: Logical function truth table.
3. **Question 3**: Gamma distribution probability density function calculation.
4. **Question 4**: Matrix operations and determinants.
5. **Question 5**: Data analysis using the 'wind.csv' dataset.

## Code Execution
To run the R code for each question, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the `code` directory.
2. Open the R script corresponding to the question (e.g., `Q1_EngineDisplacement.R`).
3. Run the script in your preferred R environment.

## Output
Any output generated by the R code will be stored in the `output` directory.

## Data
If applicable, the `data` directory contains datasets used for analysis.
